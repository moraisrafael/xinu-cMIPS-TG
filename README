This is port of Xinu to cMIPS.

This version of is slightly different from the original cMIPS.  The changes
are needed to make bearable the time for full-system VHDL simulations.

This port was started by Vanessa B A de Oliveira during 2015-2016.

--x--

The top level directory is that of cMIPS.

The directory xinu holds all the source, configuration and object files.


To compile Xinu, go into xinu/compile, and say

(cd ../lib/libxc/ ; make clean) ; make clean ; make

this creates and moves prog.bin and data.bin to the xinu-cMIPS directory,
where a "normal" cMIPS simulation can be run.

Use the -n flag to make sure the gigantic VCD files are _not_ created
unless you really want to see the waveforms:

cd ~/xinu-cMIPS ; run.sh -t 4 -u m -n
